            <p>Next to casting a ballot yourself, serving as a poll worker is the most important thing you 
            can do to help our democracy thrive. No one who is eligible to vote should be turned away from the polls,
            and we should never have voters leaving without having voted because of long, slow-moving lines or 
            confusing rules.</p>
            <p>Election rules are more complicated than ever; technology has changed the way in which we vote; 
            and our nation is more diverse by the day. We are fifteen years into the 21st Century but poll worker 
            recruitment is still back in the 20th. This tool is meant to help simplify the process of becoming a poll 
            worker – matching volunteers with opportunities and the information they need to serve their neighbors in 
            the voting process.</p>
            <p>Poll workers play a crucial role in ensuring the strength and integrity of the voting process. 
            They are the lifeblood of well-run polling places and they help secure our rights as U.S. citizens. 
            That is why we are calling on you to voice your support for your community by becoming a poll worker. 
            As part of this process, you will:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Serve inside a polling place by checking in voters, answering voters’ 
            questions, setting up and testing voting machines, issuing ballots and other tasks.</li>
            <li>Be a resource for fellow voters who encounter problems from registration problems to 
            voter ID questions to language barriers.</li>
            <li>Attend training by local election officials to learn the mechanics of the voting process 
            and what the rules are.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When working in a polling location on Election Day, there are different positions that you could fill. 
            While your responsibilities will vary by county or position, there are certain aspects of working at the 
            polls that you can count on. You will receive training by your county before Election Day, but the following 
            is a brief outline of a typical day to inform you before you apply to be a poll worker.</p>
            <p>Before Election Day you will be trained by the county that you are working in. They will give you an 
            overview of election rules, what your responsibilities will be, and some common situations that you may 
            encounter at the polls. This training may take place in person or online and will most likely last a few 
            hours.</p>
            <p>Poll workers are responsible for preparing a polling place for Election Day. Therefore, you must 
            arrive at the polling location that you are assigned to early on Election Day and assist in preparing 
            the location for voters, which can include setting up voting booths, signs or other supplies.</p>
            <p>When voters arrive at the polling location to vote, you may interact with them in different ways depending 
            upon the role you are playing at your precinct. You may be in charge of greeting voters, ensuring order in line, 
            checking voters in to receive their ballot, or assisting voters who request assistance, among other tasks. You will
            receive training before Election Day on the information that you need to know in order to complete your job.</p>
            <p>Once the polls close, anyone who is in line at the closing time will be permitted to stay in line and 
            cast their vote. As a poll worker, you are required to remain at the polling location during the entire 
            electoral process.</p>
            <p>Once the polling location is closed, you will assist in cleaning up the location and completing any other tasks
            which are necessary to close the location, secure the voting materials and transfer them to local election officials. 
            Some poll workers may be tasked with delivering ballots to a designated location, but not all poll workers are involved
            in this process.</p>
            <p>Once your duties are completed you are free to leave and enjoy watching the results unfold with the knowledge that
            you were an integral part in making Election Day possible. Sign up today to making voting possible in your 
            community!</p>
